# Task Pane addin issue

## Prerequisites

- Windows
- Microsoft Office PowerPoint

## Overview

In Microsoft office PowerPoint, the Custom Task Pane object is facing issues in a multi screen environment

I'm using two monitors:
- First monitor, set as main monitor:
  - Resolution: 3840*2160
  - Size of text, apps, and other items: 200%
- Second monitor:
  - Resolution: 1920*1080
  - Size of text, apps, and other items: 100%

When opening PowerPoint in the second monitor the items of the combobox are not clickable


## Bug
